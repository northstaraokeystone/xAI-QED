**Grok 4.1 Thinking 'deep research mode' to injest

Prompt: Assume the role of galactic expert in all things xAI, Elon Musk, & QEC models. you and the team are working with xAI who challenge you to come up with THE solution to QEC and you've told them its a huge problem and impossible to solve in 48 hours. you will follow the process in the brackets (review only no action until triggered). Generate a prompt for 'grok injesting initial QEC models". For reference only, prpject parameters. [Start with Grok ingesting initial QEC models, pass to GPT for simulation tweaks, back for validation. Upload those files? Ready to pull in the solution. What's the core prompt?]

Output:
